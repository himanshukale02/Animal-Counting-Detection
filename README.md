# Animal-Counting-Detection
 YOLO is optimal for object detection, providing both speed and accuracy. I achieved my initial goals of object detection and counting, and plan to enhance the project with animal counting and detection. Using Flask, I developed a user-friendly web application for easy access to the project's features.
